<p>21 Oct 05: Firefox 1.0.7 on Windows XP is ok</p>
<p>21 Oct 05: <span class="error">IE 6 on Windows XP is all screwed up</span>, 
and probably fixable but I can't stand debugging it (see below).</p>
<p>18 Oct 05: Firefox 1.0.6 on OS X 10.4 is ok</p>
<p>18 Oct 05: <span class="error">Safari 2.0.1 on OS X 10.4</span> is ok for browsing, but type-ahead magic and possibly the whole edit page doesn't work</p>
<p>18 Oct 05: Firefox 1.0.4 on Debian Linux is ok of course, since that's what I use</p>

<h3><a id="ie">It doesn't work in Internet Explorer!</a></h3>
<p>No, I don't expect that it does.  Don't bother to report this as a
problem, since I don't care.

you want to know why?</a></p>

<h3><a id="upload">Uploading images</a></h3>

<p>The most direct way to add more photographs to your gallery is to
upload them through the Web site.  The Upload page will allow you to
upload zero to five files at a time.  Each file may be either a single
image in JPEG format, or a ZIP archive containing as many images as
you like.  Any extra files in the ZIP archive that are not
recognizable images will be discarded.  The maximum size for a 
single file (JPEG or ZIP) is 256 MB.</p>

<p>When you are uploading a batch of images, you can pre-select
certain attributes (Date, Location, and Publication) that you want to
automatically apply to the batch.  All other attributes, such as Time
and Caption, must be edited one by one, since they don't make much
sense to apply in a batch.  No matter whether or not you pre-assign
any values, you can always go back and edit the images one by one.</p>

<p>The default value for Date is the date stamp encoded inside the
JPEG file by your digital camera.  (It need not be the same across an
entire batch; each file is examined one by one.)  The default value
for Location is nothing.  The default value for Publication is
&quot;Unsorted&quot;.  Pictures in your Unsorted pile will not be
visible to anyone except you, until you assign them to categories one
by one.</p>

<p>If you want to send a single file (JPEG or ZIP), with the default
settings, you can do this from the &quot;Quick Upload&quot; form on
your home page.</p>

<p>If you have a huge number of files to upload, it is faster to
burn them to CD or DVD and send it to me.  Files from CDs will be
added to your Unsorted box unless you specify otherwise.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3><a id="preferences">Setting preferences</a></h3>

<p>The &quot;Edit Preferences&quot; page is where you can update
your contact information, set preferences, and change your
password.</p>

<p>All of the contact information is optional.  Actually, as of now (8
Feb 2005), it is not used for anything or displayed anywhere in the
site.  In the future, at least the email address may be used by
&quot;share these pictures&quot; email functions.</p>

<p>The &quot;Gallery Style&quot; setting controls the
&quot;theme&quot; your gallery is displayed in.  If you know how to
use CSS, you can easily design your own theme and email it to me to
have it installed in the list.</p>

<p>When you change your password, make sure you know what you typed,
since you will not be asked to confirm it!</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3><a id="permissions">Managing permissions</a></h3>

<p>The ability to view pictures in the web site is controlled by
publication categories (the field called &quot;Publish&quot; on the
image editing page.) You may see any pictures that are assigned to a
category you have permission to see, no matter who they belong to.  If
you created a publication category, you are considered its
&quot;owner&quot; and you may add or remove other people from the
access control list.</p>
<p>The categories named &quot;Public&quot; and &quot;Not
Published&quot; are special.  Everybody may assign pictures to either
of these.  Everybody may view Public images, but nobody may view
images that are Not Published.  When people visit the web site and do
not log in, they can see only Public pictures.</p>
<p>Note that the site will always show you pictures that you own, even
if you assign them to a category that you cannot view, such as
&quot;Not Published&quot;.  This prevents pictures from being lost.</p>
<p>To get to the <a href="/servlet/home?action=p">Manage
Permissions</a> page, go to the <a href="/servlet/home">admin</a> page
and click &quot;Manage Permissions.&quot;</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3><a id="download">Downloading archives</a></h3>

<p>You can download ZIP archive files containing large collections of
your images from the <a href="/servlet/home?action=d">download
page</a>.  This might be useful if you want to keep a backup copy, or
if you want to move your images to another storage system (though I
don't know why you would want to do that).</p>

<p>Click any of the year links to download images from that year, or
the &quot;One big file&quot; link to download a ZIP of everything you
have ever posted.  The page will estimate the size of each file for
you; in most cases you will want to start the download and come back
in while.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3><a id="prints">Buying prints</a></h3>

<p>These days, just about any lab will take your JPEG image files
and make photographic quality prints.  <!--I am affiliated with
Shutterfly, which means that if you use the links on this site to
place an order with them, I receive money (<a
href="#payola">details</a>).  Otherwise--> I do not particularly
recommend any of these sites over the others.</p>

<p>Be sure to send the original image files when ordering prints; do not
just right-click and save the image as displayed in the photoprism web
site.  You can retrieve the original file for any of your pictures by
logging in, clicking the &quot;details&quot; view, then clicking
the &quot;original file&quot; link in the Sizes pane.</p>

<p><i>Update, 12 Apr 2005:</i> You can also have digital prints made
at any Target or Wal-Mart.  This isn't news, but recently I am seeing
that many professional photographers are perversely happy with
Wal-Mart in particular.  This is because Wal-Mart, in keeping with its
philosophy of providing rock bottom service at rock bottom prices,
performs no postprocessing or color correction before dumping the
files to the Frontier printer.  Thus your average point-and-shoot
pictures will come out looking noticeably worse, but it is ideal for
professionals that are hand profiling their images and don't want them
screwed up in the lab.</p>

<h3>Print lab price comparison</h3>

<p>All prices in the table are for single prints (that is, without any volume
or prepay discounts) and the listed shipping price is for the minimum
order.  A + sign indicates that the price goes up with volume; a -
sign indicates that the price goes down.</p>

<p>These prices were gathered on 21 February 2005.</p>
