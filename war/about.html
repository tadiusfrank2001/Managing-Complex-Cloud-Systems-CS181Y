<h3><a id="why">Why is this better than some other photo album
site?</a></h3>

<p>First of all, at the time that I started it (May 2001), there were
no other comparable online photo albums except for some rudimentary
efforts by print companies like Ofoto.  Digital cameras have become
far more common since then, and today there are many more ways of
managing their output than there used to be.  I still like my own
server for reasons that include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not commercial.  <!--Except for the <a href="#payola">affiliate
ad</a> on the front page--> All your pictures are displayed free of
junk advertising clutter.  The lack of profit motive leads naturally
to other features, such as...</li>
<li>There is an exit path.  You can easily recover the original files,
exactly as you uploaded them, individually or in archives.  This frees
you from having to keep your own backup copies in case you ever decide
you want to switch to iPhoto, another web site, etc.  What would
happen if you had hundreds of pictures in an Ofoto album, for example,
and Ofoto went out of business?  Or if they decided to start charging
a subscription fee to keep accessing your album?</li>
<li>There is no need to prepare thumbnails or do any other
preprocessing.  The server resamples the original image file on the
fly to any size that you request.</li>
<li>The server can do watermarking.  If you choose, all your pictures
are displayed with an embedded copyright message.  More intrusive
watermarks could be easily devised if this was desired.</li>
<li>Pictures are easily integrated with other Web pages.  Simple
interfaces are provided that let you embed static images or
dynamically selected ones (e.g. &quot;Latest pictures I've
posted&quot;) on any pages anywhere.</li>
<li>It has enormous capacity.  I designed the server with the
intention of using it to store every photograph I take in my entire
life.  It will scale easily to hundreds of thousands of images,
limited only by disk space.</li>
<li>It provides for privacy.  You can store every photograph you have,
even the ones that you don't want posted on the Internet for some
reason. You can select whether to make each individual image visible
to everybody, nobody, or only certain people of your choosing.</li>
<li>The multiple indexing and browsing interfaces exceed anything I
have seen in other picture galleries.</li>
<li>The technical information stored by the digital camera (date,
time, shutter speed, aperture, etc.) is automatically extracted and
made visible.</li>
<li>It is open source.  I will provide all the needed materials to
anybody else that wants to run their own server.  This means that if
you don't like the way the site develops, or if I lose interest, or if
I am hit by a bus, anybody else can continue to maintain and improve
the server software.</li>
</ul>

Everyone who uses photoprism to store or view photographs is receiving
this service for free.  Unfortunately it is somewhat expensive to
provide, so I am limited in how many accounts I can support.  If you
would like to help offset the costs of operating this site, please
consider using the ads to place an order with Shutterfly.
Shutterfly pays me $6 for each new customer registration and 10% of
each order you place in your first year as a customer.</p>

<p>Photoprism is written in <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java
servlets</a> and stores its data in the
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> 
relational database.  It should be portable to any operating system or
application platform that provides a Java servlet container.  The
original server at <a
href="http://www.photprism.net">www.photoprism.net</a> ran the <a
href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Tomcat</a> servlet container on <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>.  In the summer of 2004, it
was moved to <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> to
take advantage of the much faster <a

<p>I intend to make the photoprism site available as open source
software under the GNU GPL, but haven't yet bothered to package it up
or write much internal documentation, except for <a href="/docs">Javadoc markup</a>.
You can retrieve the source code and all of my working files through
subversion from this URL:</p>

interested in this, since I would like to work with you.</p>
